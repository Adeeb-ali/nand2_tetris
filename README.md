🖥️ Nand to Tetris – My Hardware Journey

<h3>Welcome to my Nand to Tetris project! 🎉
This is part of my journey through the famous course where we build a computer system from the ground up — starting with NAND gates and ending with a full computer capable of running programs.

🔧 What I’m Building

✅ Logic gates (built only from NAND)

✅ Combinational circuits (MUX, ADDER, etc.)

✅ Sequential circuits (Registers, Counters, RAM)

🔄 18-bit Instruction ALU (work in progress ⚡)

🏗️ Instruction set architecture and machine language

💻 End goal: a functioning computer from scratch!</h3>

 📂 Current Progress

I’m currently working on the 18-bit ALU which will handle arithmetic & logical operations for my CPU design.

Step by step, I’ll integrate this into the full instruction set and test programs on my custom-built computer.

✨ Why This Matters

This project is special because it’s not about using prebuilt libraries or shortcuts — it’s about truly understanding how computers work at the lowest level. By the end, I’ll have a working computer that I built gate by gate, chip by chip.

🚀 Next Steps

Finish ALU implementation

Connect it with CPU control logic

Run my first custom program on the hardware model

# 🌟 About the Course

This work is inspired by the course “From NAND to Tetris”, which challenges you to construct a full computer system, starting with the most fundamental building block — the NAND gate.
